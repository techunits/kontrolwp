The custom settings module allows you to use the power of our custom fields to create your own sets of custom settings / options for your CMS. 

These are highly useful for creating and storing information / images / files that don't need to be tied to any post, but instead help control how the site works. All custom settings fields support a wide array of validation methods (required, email, URL etc) and can be organised into categories with their own admin menu entry for ease of access. From simple text fields, to an advanced image upload or even a 'repeatable' field, you'll find the field type you need for virtually any type of custom setting you need to add to your CMS.

1. The Kontrol custom fields interface.
2. If your frontend requires images at a certain height or width, no problem. Just configure the image upload custom field to resize or crop the image you need to the exact height and width you need on the front end. This is all done the instant the user uploads an image.
3. If you need certain effects applied to images, we've got that covered too. Automatically sharpen, blur, greyscale and more when the user uploads an image.
4. Create unlimited copies of a single image. If you use an image on the front end in different places at different sizes, you can automatically set the custom field to create several copies of the 'original' image that is uploaded by the user. This is very handy if you also need to automatically create thumbnails of the image at different sizes with different effects. 
5. Kontrol now supports full internationalisation (i18n) which means the entire plugin can be easily converted to any other language. At the moment we only support English in full, but we currently have partial language support for over 20 langauges (validation error messages, date messages etc). If you would be interested in converting Kontrol in full to your native language, we'd love to show you how and even give you several free copies of the full version of Kontrol for your efforts. [View our site for more information](https://www.kontrolwp.com/plugin/wordpress-developer-kit/languages-supported).
6. When viewing a post types posts (think of the screen when you click on the 'Pages' or 'Posts' menu item in the admin area), you usually just see the 'Title' and 'Date' of all the posts. But with our custom post type module, you can easily create new columns, reorder existing columns, add data from custom fields, taxonomies and virtually any other information about that post. You can even show data from a Kontrol 'Repeatable' field in these columns! Flexibility for post type columns has never been seen like this before.
7. Easily create new custom post types in just seconds. Our custom post type module supports just about every setting available for creating new custom post types.
8. Kontrol SEO is up there with the best available for Wordpress. Automatically generate SEO content for sites with thousands of pages in just a few seconds, or create SEO templates to automatically generate smart SEO content when creating new pages, posts etc. + a lot more.
9. Need a nice clean backend Wordpress interface when delivering a CMS to a client? No problem, just use our menu editor to rearrange, edit, add, delete or hide all elements from the backend admin menu. Hide what you don't need to show the client and also add in your own custom menu icons for menu entries for that extra bit of polish.
10. All custom fields support advanced options for showing or hiding them depending on what you need for your custom CMS. You can even show / hide custom fields and groups based on the value or partial value of another custom field. This advanced field dependancy allows you to create some incredibly flexible and powerful groups of custom fields.
11. When creating custom fields you can also add tool tips next to them. This allows you to show the user more information or examples in regards to that custom field.
12. Kontrols custom fields are unrivaled in their advanced usage and ease of use. For image custom fields you can restrict the file types allowed to be chosen (even the names of the files), limit the max file size, resize the image, crop the image, make copies of the image and much more.
